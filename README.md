## My process

- I maintained high contrast ratios (13.1:1, 7.74:1) throughout the website, passing all WCAG tests. Tested using [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=000000&bcolor=16DFBD).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Redux

### What I learned

- I learned how to utilize Regex to search for patterns.

### Continued development

I want to implement a paragraph counter, which calls for more advanced Regex knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) - I ran my index.html through this conformance checker to catch any unintended mistakes.
- [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - I ran my style.css through this conformance checker to catch any unintended mistakes.
